To edit a map, use ./my_runner -e map_name
To create a new map, use ./my_runner -n nb_lines map_name
You can also use the graphical interface with ./my_runner

map_name : the name of the map
nb_lines : the number of lines in the level.

Map format :
    Each bloc is defined by one byte.
    Data format :
        The first byte is the number of lines in the level in byte format.
        The rest of the file is all the data grouped by columns.
        e.g. :
            2 - l1c1 - l2c1
              - l1c2 - l2c2
              - l1c3 - l2c3
        The number of columns is defined by the file lengh.
    Bloc format :
        The bloc ID is defined by the 6 first bits.
        The bloc type is defined by the 2 last bits :
            0 for solid static
            1 for solid dynamic
            2 for hollow static
            3 for hollow dynamic
